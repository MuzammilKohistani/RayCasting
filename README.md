Welcome to the RayCast FPS Game project! This is a collaborative effort between Muzammil Kohistani and Ahmed Cengiz Yavuz to create a first-person shooting game using C++ and OpenGL. The primary focus of this project is on implementing ray casting techniques to simulate a 3D environment and deliver an immersive gaming experience.
